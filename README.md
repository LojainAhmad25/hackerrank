Excited to share that I've recently earned two certifications from HackerRank!
• Problem Solving (Basic) – reinforcing my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithmic thinking.
• Python (Basic) – solidifying core programming concepts in one of the most widely used languages today.
These achievements represent important progress in strengthening my technical foundation, and I’m eager to continue applying these skills in practical projects and future opportunities.
Grateful for the learning process and looking forward to what’s next.
